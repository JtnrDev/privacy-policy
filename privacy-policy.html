  <hr>

  <h2>Service Providers</h2>
  <p>We do not employ third-party services that access your personal information within the app.</p>
  <p>However, app distribution via the Google Play Store and services like Google Analytics (if used) may collect usage data in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We value your trust in providing your personal information. All data entered into Vehicle Logs is stored locally on your device and is never shared with or accessed by us.</p>
  <p>While we strive to protect your data, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
